Currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science at UCLA. My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I am also interested in software and web development technologies.

### Experience

My corporate working experience include software engineering internships at Qualcomm, San Diego and Cisco, Bengaluru.

At Qualcomm, I am working on Machine Vision for autonomous vehicles which involves openVx framework application development. My work also focuses on identifying the gaps in the framework and leveraging the robustness of the snapdragon processor.

At Cisco, I have worked on Virtualization component in UCS Director. My work was focused on transitioning a task-based REST architecture of UCSD into a resource-based architecture. Also included Role-based access conrol mechnaisms and workflows.
